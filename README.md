## Portfolios built with it

- [Example portfolio](https://jhow.io/portfolio-generator) (The default one created by this portfolio)

- [Jonathan Santos](https://portfolio.jhow.io)

## How to use it

0. Have [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org) installed in your computer (Preferably version 12 or higher)

1. Fork and `git clone` the repository

2. Run the command `npm install` to install the `npm` dependencies in the project

3. Edit the `portfolio.json` inside the `src/data` folder with information about your projects and yourself

4. Define if you want to have multiple languages in your portfolio:

    4.1. If you don't want multiple languages, delete `src/data/pt-BR.json`, `src/data/es-MX.json`, `src/templates/pt-BR/` and `src/templates/es-MX`

    4.2. If you want multiple languages, create (or modify current) language versions of your `portfolio.json` in `src/data` (for example the `pt-BR.json` or `es-MX`) and update the folders in `src/templates` (for example, you want a french version? Duplicate the `pt-BR/` folder, rename it to `fr-FR` and edit their contents)

5. See the resulting website running the command `npm start`, access the resulting website in [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

6. Liked the result? Then you have two options for deploying the website:

    6.1. [`Github Pages(Easy)`] Deploy the repository in a github repository ([like this](https://github.com/jonathan-santos/portfolio)), Change the `src/data/portfolio.json` property `root` to `portfolio` ([like this](https://github.com/jonathan-santos/portfolio/raw???)), and then in your computer run the command `npm run deploy`

    6.2. [Deploy yourself] Run the command `npm run build`, it will build all the static website files in the folder `public`, you can then copy the folder content and deploy it to different places to deploy your portfolio (many free by the way):
      - [Netifly](https://www.netlify.com/)
      - [Github pages - Manually](https://pages.github.com/)
      - [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/free/webapps/?trk=ps_a134p000006gXwDAAU)
      - [Your own dev server](https://kutt.it/7nbVKz)

7. And for the most important step, share your published portfolio, do it in [linkedin](https://linkedin.com), in your github profile, in your [twitter](https://twitter.com) or any other place you like. But please share it with me, I'd like to see it and, if you would like it, to add in this `README`, I'll be happy to do it üëç

## Portfolio.json

The file `src/data/portfolio.json` is the file used to configure how the resulting website will be, from colors and styles, to categories and projects, all is in this file (and the different languages like `pt-BR.json` or `es-MX.json`).
